# VMWare Fusion 10 Mount Shared Folder

The shared folder feature of VMWare Fusion 10 on MacOS doesn't work as the shared folder doesn't show up in the guest system, especially in Linux systems.

The issue can be solved by manually run the following command:[^EF0346E4679D]

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs -o subtype=vmhgfs-fuse,allow_other
```

or add an entry in the /etc/fstab

```bash
vmhgfs-fuse /mnt/hgfs fuse defaults,allow_other 0 0
```

A similar issue happens in VirtualBox, which can be solved by [[201910261933]]
