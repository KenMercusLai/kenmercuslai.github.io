# Devonthink Workflow

we can use databases to store documents with very specific purposes[^DE744171C157]. I categorize them as following:

* Inboxes: input of all new documents
* References: webpage scraped, books, PDFs, videos and etc. that are read and noted
* Stalled: documents for reference in case, probably will never be changed. like enroll form, certificates and etc.
* Projects: All files related to projects.


For things that is currently working on, we can make a separate folder/database which replicate all documents from somewhere else[@DE744171C157]. The files in the folder is dynamic and periodically checked and cleaned up.
