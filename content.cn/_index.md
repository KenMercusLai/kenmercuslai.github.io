# About me

Hi, this is Ken Lai and I've been working in the IT industry for more than 10 years. 

I've joined Cisco twice, one as a system engineer and one as a security consultant. I provided services to state-owned agencies, organizations and companies such as ministry of defense, armies, intelligent agencies and other commercial companies.

Besides my work in Cisco, I managed operation centers and security centers of more than 10 engineers in my previous positions for system high availability and security to serve over one million users. I also led a team to provide consultancy, design, and deployment for clients. My major projects including digital broadcasting systems and province-level core network designs covering tens of millions citizens when I work in state-owned companies. 

I'm currently focusing on network automation of on-premise and cloud platforms. I've demonstrated and created automation systems based on standard platform and fully-customized software.
