# SSL VPN Pros & Cons

SSL VPN pros:
1. More adaptable to almost all environment. Only a HTTP service needs to be exposed to the INTERNET.
2. only a browser is needed; other services in an intra-net will be proxied by the browser service

cons:
1. 3 major SSL VPN vendors dominate 75% market share, so any exploit is highly repeatable.
2. easily be forgotten after deployment
