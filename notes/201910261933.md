# VirtualBox Mount Shared Folder

Similar to [[201910241123]], the shared folder may not work in a guest machine.

The issue can be solved by using the following command:[^EF14DADFE043]

```bash
sudo mount -t vboxsf shared ~/shared
```

if we want to mount the folder as other users, we can specify the user and group ids

```bash
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared ~/shared
```
