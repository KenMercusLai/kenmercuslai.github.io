# Unmount Busy Devices

If it's reported busy when trying to unmount a device in Linux, we can use following commands to do so forcefully[^2D8611399BEB]:

```bash
umount -l /PATH/OF/BUSY-DEVICE
umount -f /PATH/OF/BUSY-NFS(NETWORK-FILE-SYSTEM)
```

[^2D8611399BEB]: [[lvm - umount: /: target is busy - Ask Ubuntu]]
