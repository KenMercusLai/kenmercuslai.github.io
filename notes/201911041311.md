# About Productivity, Efficacy and Efficiency

Nick stated productivity as "having a shippable product", and efficacy as generating something "useful”[^76833E2B968E], which I interpret differently.

I think Nick combine the definitions of productivity and effectiveness as a whole to illustrate his idea, but I'd like to keep them separate. Here's the definitions for those three words:

* Efficiency: How many things can be done in a period, which are not necessarily influential?
* Effectiveness: How influential a work can be (in the future)?
* Productivity: How effective in a period?

Productivity has compound meanings which measure the number of jobs can be done and the influence to the future. I also prioritise efficacy over efficiency a lot in productivity since the works are meaningless if they don't shift the future in a better way.
