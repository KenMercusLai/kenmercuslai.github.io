# Ignore Hypes of Starting Companies

There are a lot of stories about how well-known and successful CEOs started their companies in just an overnight and deadly simple reason. They are all hypes, untrue and delusional.

As the example of Walmart[^18699533CF5B], basically none of the story is true for how the giant is so successful. Articles, stories, and videos are tend to make the truth more dramatical to allure eyeballs. This has NEVER been good for studying and learning from their experience. On the other side, details like what obstacles, pitfalls, difficulties and etc. have faced, how they are solved, and why the choices are made are extremely valuable for studying. However, almost all of them are ignored or just scratched surfaces. This type of articles are low in knowledge density, providing nothing more than a piece for gossip.
