# Pros & Cons of using microservices

Pros: Easier to test, deploy, and monitor
since each service works independently,
1. service can scale better at a specific bottleneck
2. can serving older and newer version at the same time, and let older ones phase out gradually
3. development, test & deployment of each service is independent


Cons: latency between services and management issue
1. A service depending on several calls to others may suffer from a huge delay
2. different teams may work on the same/similar service at the same time, extra assessments are needed.

Besides, good documentation is always needed and a discovery tool also make operation easier.
