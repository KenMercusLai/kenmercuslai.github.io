# ZettelKasten method

An idea or a note is only meaningful under a certain context which may be different from its origin of the idea or the note[^63D69D2FDE0F]. How to extract ideas from their sources is critical for my later work, in which I believe understanding is what I've been missing for years.

I used to take notes in margins of books and highlight parts of texts, which are barely helpful or memorable after a period. Both ways are collecting or extracting ideas from its source, making them hard to understand later since I lose the context and have to re-read them. Also, highlighting is simply another way of quoting, which skip the understanding step of taking notes unconsciously as well.

ZettelKasten method consist of the following steps in general [^09D3BB9E6FB1] [^5F46133515F0]:
1. Collecting
2. Understanding
3. Linking/Enriching

These steps are similar to the GTD methodology[^C8B3F7EEA16B]: collecting, organising and acting. Hence the ZettelKasten is also called as "The GTD of taking notes"[^C8B3F7EEA16B]

# Why writing

Writing can
1. help me stick with the point [^819286B7343B]
2. stop jumping around in my mind and focus on how the idea develops [^819286B7343B]
3. be used as-is [^819286B7343B]
4. generate information which requires understanding, thoughts and interpretation.[^E91300116054][[201911081833]]
5. persistent an idea and re-use it [^76833E2B968E]

It's estimated that 1000 notes is the turning point.[^F4AEC7A258F0]

# Strength

The ZettelKasten method has a balance between order and freedom [^4995C4EA2355]: not too strict that can't fit into a new idea, nor too loose that is hard to be organised. It grows by **writing** more as an anti-fragile system[[201911081703]], by adding more knowledge[[201911081833]] to the external brain with writings.

# Add new notes [^BF4B36F92A08]

When adding a new note, a workflow can be used:

1. Search for similar content
2. Are they related? [[201910022118]] (One topic one note {[^09D3BB9E6FB1], [^4995C4EA2355] P. 2}

=> exactly
4. modify existence / add reference

=> partially
4. create a new note, write in a clear form [[201911102156]]
5. make a note for comparison / add annotation / relationship
6. link notes {[^4995C4EA2355] P. 5, [^1F4630456C3F]}

=> none
4. create a new note, write in a clear form [[201911102156]]
5. determine tags/keywords
6. link notes {[^4995C4EA2355] P. 5, [^1F4630456C3F]}


# Types of notes

* Fleeting Notes. Temporary & everything. Like the inbox for GTD.[^09D3BB9E6FB1] [^7394259B61E7] [^63D69D2FDE0F]
* Permanent Notes. Distilled. From systematic writing or organising fleeting notes.[^09D3BB9E6FB1] [^7394259B61E7] [^63D69D2FDE0F]
* Project Notes. Things related to a project only, which provide minimal help outside of the project and is mainly used as a reference.[^09D3BB9E6FB1] [^7394259B61E7]


Writing, summaries (context notes [^8C5B913CB1B7]) and idea collections can be treated as permanent notes or different notes in each categories. The categorisation depends on whether notes are purely incoming knowledge from outside or not. If they are, then these three should be put into different categories accordingly[^7394259B61E7]; if they aren't, they can be set as fleeting or permanent notes. Reference note[^63D69D2FDE0F] can also be another type to be treated separately, which consists of the referred text and reflection on each note. Each reference note will then be linked with other notes (reference notes/permanent notes/writing/summaries).

# No category
There's no need to determine category for each note. Instead, using tags as anchors and links to connect notes. (pp.14 of [^E54B407A176C])
