# Good Online Services

[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is a service to mimic REST API calls and returns before the back-end has been developed. It supports on-line service with default data and build on-premise if there's a custom data required.

It enables the separation between frond-end and back-end development, which should be considered and used more in later work.
