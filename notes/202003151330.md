# How to find which process has occupied a specific port

## Methods

### netstat[^1]

```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo netstat -ltnp 
```

### lsof[^1]

```bash
sudo apt install lsof
sudo lsof -i :80
```

* DON'T forget the `:` before the port number

### fuser[^1]

```bash
sudo apt install psmisc
# show a port number is listening by a process number
sudo fuser 3306/tcp  
# check the process name by the process number
ps -p [processID] -o comm=
```
