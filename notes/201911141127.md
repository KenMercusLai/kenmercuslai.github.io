# Ways' of Detecting Delusional Companies

Here's some ways of detecting delusional companies, especially startups.

1. Claim to make you rich.
2. Playing blame game. The toxic aspect is either complaining about leadership or leadership blaming specific people and teams across the whole company. It's a culture that throw each other under the bus, it doesn't function well.
3. Happy about the current state, stop seeking for better. Once you're happy, you're in a maintenance mode. Any production stuck in the maintenance mode is in a slow death, because competition brings out good stuff across the board.
