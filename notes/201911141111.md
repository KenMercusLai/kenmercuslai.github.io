# Nornir's Speed for automation

Ansible is a single-thread framework that each task can only run after its previous one. When automating a large scale network (>= 1000), it's performance will become the main drawback.

On the other hand, Nornir is implemented in multi-thread, the time-complexity is lower than Ansible predictably.
