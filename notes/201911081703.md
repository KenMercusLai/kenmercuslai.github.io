# Fragile & Robust

Nassim Taleb's three-concept model includes:

* Fragile, means something doesn't tolerate variability.
* Robust, which is NOT the opposite of fragile in his model, means something that doesn't change with variability
* Anti-fragile, the opposite of fragile in the context, means improvement with variability.

A system can be easily determined by bring new variables into it:

* if the system's performance, stability, reliability or etc. decreases, it's fragile
* if the system remains the same, it's robust
* if the system improves overall, it's anti-fragile
