High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight

HICT can be a fast and efficient way of lose weight and fat and an efficient approach to decreasing insulin resistance too.[^1]

* 8-12 repetitions are recommend by ACSM for each major muscle group  of a bout[^1]
* people with hypertension or deart disease should **avoid** isometric exercises. [^1]
* It may **NOT** good for training for absolute strength, specific endurance and other specific performance.[^1]

Exercise Order

The object is to allow a series of exercises in proper form and technique in quick succession with minimal rest in between (<=15s)

* Using opposing muscle groups in subsequent exercises (Upper body, lower body, core, etc.)
* Alternative between exercises which significantly increase and reduce heart rate (cardio-intensive and strength-intensive)

Number of Exercises

* No ideal number
* 30 seconds a bout is usually enough 
* 2-3 circuits may be required to reach exercise purpose, since most people may not exceed 100% V.O2max.
