# What is Hard Working?

Hard working is the job done with the best performance in terms of expense, time, labor, standardized and etc. Hence, for the same outcome[^11E6E16C603F], whoever brings more effectiveness and efficiency is working hard instead of who simply spends more time.

We never promote a mule even it has been working for grinding all its life.
