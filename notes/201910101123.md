# Network Threats

As listed by IANA, 224.0.0.0/24 is a reserved multicast range[^1]. Since all host should listen to 224.0.0.1 and all routers should listen to 224.0.0.2 according the list, sending a huge volume of multicast to this range will kill network devices by overwhelming their CPU, which is designed to process the multicast traffic and won't be protected by CoPP.[^7B4FCF0F9AC9]
