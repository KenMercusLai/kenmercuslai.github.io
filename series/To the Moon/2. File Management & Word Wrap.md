We need to tune Emacs a little bit to make it fit us more.


# File Exploration & Search

Since I don't want to remember what each file name is and what contant each file contains, which I don't believe anyone can do as well, we need a good tool to quickly browsing, filtering, and editing our notes under the our root folder. Here I use [Deft](https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) to handle it.

It's easy to install it in Spacemacs by simply add `deft` in the layer section of its `~/.spacemacs`.

```lisp
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '(
     ;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
     ;; Example of useful layers you may want to use right away.
     ;; Uncomment some layer names and press <SPC f e R> (Vim style) or
     ;; <M-m f e R> (Emacs style) to install them.
     ;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
     helm
     auto-completion
     ;; better-defaults
     emacs-lisp
     git
     markdown
     org
     (org :variables org-startup-indented t
          org-indent-mode t
          org-enable-reveal-js-support t
          org-enable-org-journal-support t)
     deft
     ;; (shell :variables
     ;;        shell-default-height 30
     ;;        shell-default-position 'bottom)
     ;; spell-checking
     ;; syntax-checking
     version-control
     )
```

Save the file, and use `SPC f e R` to reload the configuration. Deft will be installed after the loading finishes. Then we need to config where deft should search and what extensions are interested.

```lisp
(setq deft-extensions '("org"))
(setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/orgmode")
(setq deft-recursive t)
```

Save and reload the configuration, you can use `SPC a n` to open `deft`. If you need a even quicker way to open deft, you can bind it with a function key.

```lisp
(global-set-key [f8] 'deft)
```

Also, I think you'd like to use `deft-find-file` to replace build-in `C-x C-f` since it supports sub-folders.


# Word wrap

We use Emacs for writing notes instead of codes, so the 80-width rule (or 120-width) won't apply here well. It's easy to enable word wrap in Emacs:

    M-x toggle-word-wrap

If you want to it enable by default, you can add the following to your config file like me:

```lisp
;; enable word wrap
(spacemacs/toggle-truncate-lines-on)
;; Visual line navigation for textual modes
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'spacemacs/toggle-visual-line-navigation-on)
```
