To first get org-mode work, I need to install Emacs first on my Mac system. There're several versions of Emacs when I write this part (2020): emacsformacsosx, aquamacs, emacs, emacs-plus and emacs-mac from homebrew. I'd like to skip wasting my time comparing the nuances among these versions since I don't believe there're important differences for beginners like me. If there is any, I can simply google and switch to another one, which I don't think will happen recently.

Second, I prefer to stand on other's talents' shoulders to directly get the best out of them. Several configurations are available to quickly make vanilla Emacs into a modern, fancy editor and I finally choose to use [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]].

* Install Emacs and Spacemacs

If you don't have Emacs installed on your system, any version I mentioned above is good to have a try. I stick with the installation guide of the Spacemacs:
#+begin_src bash 
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus
ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-plus/Emacs.app /Applications
#+end_src

The current version of brew has dropped the support of =linkapps= command, so I link the app to the =Applications= folder. Then, if this is NOT a fresh install, please back up your =~/.emacs.d= folder since we will overwrite it for the Spacemacs.
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

The next step is to install fonts as prefered for the Spacemacs from [[https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro][here]].

* Basic Setup

After the installation is done, we need to run Spacemacs (Emacs) for the first time to generate its default configuration in =~/.spacemacs=. If you don't see any warning or error messages (usually in red), that means you have everything installed correctly.

I set up my Spacemacs in VIM mode and use helm for managing packages.

** config layers
After all modules have been loaded, we can use =SPC f e d= to load the configuration file, which is the only file you're supposed to change for Spacemacs. Let's find =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= and enable some =layers= we need. 
[[imghttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenMercusLai/kenmercuslai.github.io/pics/uPic/0BooQY.png][configuration layers]]

Each time we change the config, we can use =SPC f e R= to check and install layers to make sure what we have is correct.

** user config
Let's scroll down to almost the bottom of the config file to find =user-config= section: 
#+begin_src elisp
defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
#+end_src

if you have any experience of programming, you can easily tell if a function, which runs after all Spacemacs modules have been loaded. Here we want to add some code to customize it.
*** Loading & Storing Paths

I want to store my org files in Dropbox so they will be automatically synced each time I change. This allows me to work seamlessly on different devices. Also, there may some scripts I want to add but not as layers in the Spacemacs, so I need to create a folder to store them and tell the Spacemacs where they are. 

Let's add the following lines as the first two lines to make sure they're defined before using.
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar org-root-folder "~/Dropbox/orgmode/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
#+end_src

*Please manually change the paths to reflect where they are on your computer.*
*** Auto sync with Dropbox
If you somehow like me usually work on different devices but don't want to spend time on backing up your files and get everything consistent across them, services like Dropbox is one of the best choices. I use it as my harddisk, so I don't need a large local hard drive. This actually has saved me a lot of money if you do the math, especially for a Macbook Pro. If you have a similar service like it, you can put the files in the synced folder (=~/Dropbox/config= for me) and make symbol links to automatically get everything consistent.
   #+begin_src shell
ln -s ~/Dropbox/configs/.spacemacs ~/.spacemacs
ln -s ~/Dropbox/configs/lisp ~/.emacs.d/lisp
   #+end_src

After this, you won't need to spend any more time on make everything consistent after tuning any configuration or script files on one device *with internet*.
