I'm working on a project that tries to reduce less related YouTube videos by using machine learning. The project is quite interesting, and it gives me a chance to build up a working serverless backend on AWS. 

I want to share my experience of building it. I'll use some dummy functions to reflect the computational consumptions, since I can't leak any sensitive information like algorithms.

In the series, I'll try to express everything in my first person though not every idea is originated by myself.
