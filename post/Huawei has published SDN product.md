I've walked through the news from official website about SDN, which I thought was a missing part of their product line, and found a interesting [one](http://enterprise.huawei.com/ilink/enenterprise/news-event/news/news-list/HW_277550). Seems Huawei finally caught up with the SDN bus.

I personally don't think what has been mentioned in the news will bring truly impact to the SDN market, and prefer to take it as only a symbol for Huawei entering the SDN game. Here are some of my reasons:

- Huawei has showed **ONLY** one product for the market, which is futile in my opinion, because we are asking for the solution instead of blind faith in that one device could solve the whole problem.
- Huawei hasnâ€™t mentioned any detail in applications or campus controller. I suppose the obscure words is a sign of unripe production.
- Huawei is a member of OpenFlow and OpenDaylight, but it seems devoid of activity and influence.

Anyhow, Huawei has something to talk finally while other giants have already played this for quite a while. I don't know this is a kind of special strategy or just lacking of R&D investment. But it is good to see another big company has taken its hand into this. I'm looking forward to seeing the marketing fight between Cisco and Huawei.
