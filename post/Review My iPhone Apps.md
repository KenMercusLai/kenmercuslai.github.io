I’ve never been an apple fan even there are 2 iPhones, 3 iPads, 4 iPods and 2 Laptops in my house. And I’m glad to recommend using iPhone & some great iPhone apps to my friends every time when I was asked. One major reason for addicting into apple is the softwares on them which give me simplicity and convenience, also have improved my productivity. After experiencing lots of free/paid apps. I think a summary for them could help me to find great apps in future, and any one who is discovering.


# Brief history of my iPhone apps


**I declare that I have purchased all the softwares which are not free for using.**
