      <title>How does flowtrackd detect DDoS in DSR</title>

      <guid>https://kenlai.me/post/How-does-flowtrackd-detect-DDoS-in-DSR/</guid>
      
        <description>Cloudflare recently announced flowtrackd which can detect DDoS in [DSR]([[Direct Server Return]]) scenarios. It&amp;rsquo;s quite interesting since most DDoS protections need the gateway working in the reverse proxy mode, in which the traffic coming and leaving through the same device. Then the gateway can track connection statuses since it observes every packet. I am not an employee of Cloudflare and have no insight of how flowtrackd is designed, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to have an educated guess.</description>

      <guid>https://kenlai.me/post/Blue-Team-and-Red-Team/</guid>
      
        <description>One of the most common questions is the difference between the red and blue teams. People are also confused about why there are two teams in cybersecurity and can one replace the other? In short, there are two teams by standing on two perspectives in cybersecurity, and we need them both.
The blue team stands on the defender&amp;rsquo;s side, in which the team focuses on visibility, context, and control. On the other hand, the red team is on the attacker&amp;rsquo;s point to test the strength of points in defense.</description>

      <guid>https://kenlai.me/post/I-have-a-CCIE-so-whats-my-level-of-security/</guid>
      
        <description>CCIE is a good proof of what you have learnt, but it may be far away from what you will experience.
The past 2018, I hosted a couple of security workshops all over the world. During them, I was asked the same question for many times: &amp;ldquo;I am trying to have/have passed a certificate of xxx, what&amp;rsquo;s my level in the security area?&amp;rdquo; Like what I always suggest people who ask a similar question of CCIE, I&amp;rsquo;d like to use the most well-known terminology in the networking industry: It depends, which can be illustrated in two perspectives.</description>

        <description>Through my consulting experience started from last year, there were a couple of times when attendees were talking about the performance and usability issues of their security products. Interestingly enough, I found most of these issues were not related to the performance and features at all. Instead, they were more close to how devices are bought.
Among the discussions, a shared process is locking a brand, then deciding which models had the best fit in their environment and finally sought partners for the final procurement.</description>

        <description>Scaling up a network will face a lot of issues that don&amp;rsquo;t appear when it&amp;rsquo;s small. In this post, let&amp;rsquo;s look at what problems are they.
Stateful applications One of the most important decisions that make the Internet possible is to make the network stateless and push applications which are usually need to store states to end users. In the development of the network, stateful applications are inserted for certain purposes.</description>

        <description>When networks are getting deeper and deeper into our everyday work life, they have become more and more complex. Opposed to traditional networks, their functionalities are wider and wider, which challenge the principles existed. Today&amp;rsquo;s networks demand better performance, scalability, flexibility, better operational cost efficiency and maximize link capacities. All the requirements force the network to have certain automation and can be managed by a centralized controller. This idea of managing the network is call software-defined-network (SDN).</description>

        <description>Virtualenvwrapper is one of the must-have scripts for building a Python development environment. With the power of zsh oh-my-zsh plugin framework, we can automate some processes such as activate &amp;amp; deactivate.
But the build-in virtualenvwrapper fails to work sometimes what it should be. I decided to fix it by myself after googling for existed solutions.

        <description>I recently had a chance to speak with a supervisor, who is called such by his colleagues, from Huawei. He mentioned that Huawei was trying doing outsourcing IT management service for SP customers. This approaching reminds me that Cisco is also thriving to bring management service into China. I don’t think this is a coincidence that two biggest companies in the same industry are doing the same.
The only difference is that Huawei is expecting to have a proliferation out of China mainland, while Cisco is trying to bring this concept into China.</description>

        <description>Why we need network simulation As a network engineer, I have to spend a lot of time in the lab or test environment on testing concepts, configuration, troubleshooting and so on. This is also true for people whose work environment is related to a network such as developers, DBAs. The problem here is that the lab sometimes so perfect that it cannot emulate the real world flaws like latency, packet loss, re-order or bandwidth limitation.</description>

Scenario 1: Switch forwarding multicast traffic to a multicast router and hosts In the topology shown above, the switch acting as a pure L2 device interconnects multicast router, which directly connects to the Source A for multicast group 239.</description>

        <description>What does IGMP Snooping Do IGMP snooping is used to monitor the traffic of IGMP protocol between hosts and multicast-enabled routers. The switch uses it to learn which interface has an interested receiver and forward multicast traffic only to these interfaces. This feature could save bandwidth by allowing it to send traffic only needed, rather than flooding all multicast packets to all interfaces.
IGMP Snooping and Forwarding Interfaces To determine how to forward multicast traffic, IGMP snooping maintains a “table” about the interfaces information:</description>

        <description>After a long absence, I returned to continue playing CheckIO tasks by a notification mail. The UI had been optimized a lot and the tasks were still as interesting as the before.
Inside Block required checking whether a given point is inside a polygon or not. After some research on google, I found a practical method.
How to check if a given point is in a polygon Given a polygon and a point ‘p’, find if ‘p’ lies inside the polygon or not.</description>

        <description>The reason behind why I almost instantly became a big fan of Cisco FEX and satellite card technology is that, both of them provide tremendous complexity reduction in many aspects, like planning, managing, deploying and even the knowledge requirements for engineers.
I think no one would argue that there are a lot of great tools from CLI to GUI or whole sets of applications can improve the engineer&amp;rsquo;s work effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>What is hot/cold aisle in data center</title>

      <guid>https://kenlai.me/post/What-is-hotcold-aisle-in-data-center/</guid>
      
        <description>A hot/cold aisle is a layout design for server racks in a data center. The goal of it is to increase the effectiveness of the cooling system by managing airflow in a data center.
In the simplest form, this design involves lining up server racks in different rows with cold air facing one way and hot exhausts facing the other. Typically, cold aisles, which are usually composed of rack fronts, face AC output, and hot aisles face return ducts.</description>

        <description>Cisco ASA firewall has upgraded its command line at the version 8.3 and changed a lot of configurations from their previous style. I recently faced two cases about NO-NAT in both version and want to leave a quick note here.
Example details:
 inside IP address: 1.1.1.0/24 outside IP address: 2.2.2.0/24 traffic go through from inside interface to outside interface  Before 8.3 An access-list is needed to filter the interested traffic.</description>

        <description>Companies usually take experiences from others in the same industry or the ones share a lot of characters. This is also similar to Chinese companies in cable SPs. Every time I heard about what they wanted to learn from when we were discussing future business development, Comcast is always the one they like. But from my personal view, I prefer to consider this is an error to position themselves like Comcast because there are no share characteristics except for being called cable SPs.</description>

        <description>Companies drop their products while they are benefit-able, it seems that Huawei is abandoning CDN from its mainstream products in China.
Lacking of clients may be one critical fact that this product cannot provide sufficient profit for Huawei. From this aspect of how many new clients a product has been sold while no expansion for old clients, the only considerable one is China Mobile Sichuan. Less R&amp;amp;D force for less profitable product principle makes CDN have less support.</description>

A minority of them noticed their advantages and disadvantages and chose to orient to the content providers. Wasu is one of the minority group members, and it has a totally different business orientation with other three strongest MG in China.</description>

      <guid>https://kenlai.me/post/Experiences-about-CloudFlare/</guid>
      
        <description>I spent about three hours to migrate my tech blog from OpenShift &amp;amp; CloudFlare to GitHub again, after my moving all from GitHub to OpenShift about 2 month ago. Experience with OpenShift &amp;amp; CloudFlare was frustrating and awful. It didn’t hit any expectations that I thought before the first migration.
Why I want to use CDN Choosing a free hosting by OpenShift for me is mesmerized by its potential customization in the future, rather than cost consideration.</description>

Without any doubt, I purchased one from the Internet even it had never been released in China.</description>

The only problem I have is its machine learning backed recommendation system which usually give me things totally out of sense, like videos in a language that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, clickbaits and poorly made videos etc. This system is so sensitive that I may be bombasted with uninterested videos after I accidentally watch a video of a type.</description>

        <description>To first get org-mode work, I need to install Emacs first on my Mac system. There&amp;rsquo;re several versions of Emacs when I write this part (2020): emacsformacsosx, aquamacs, emacs, emacs-plus and emacs-mac from homebrew. I&amp;rsquo;d like to skip wasting my time comparing the nuances among these versions since I don&amp;rsquo;t believe there&amp;rsquo;re important differences for beginners like me. If there is any, I can simply google and switch to another one, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think will happen recently.</description>

File Exploration &amp;amp; Search Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to remember what each file name is and what contant each file contains, which I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anyone can do as well, we need a good tool to quickly browsing, filtering, and editing our notes under the our root folder. Here I use Deft to handle it.
