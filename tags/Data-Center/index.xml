      <description>A hot/cold aisle is a layout design for server racks in a data center. The goal of it is to increase the effectiveness of the cooling system by managing airflow in a data center.
In the simplest form, this design involves lining up server racks in different rows with cold air facing one way and hot exhausts facing the other. Typically, cold aisles, which are usually composed of rack fronts, face AC output, and hot aisles face return ducts.</description>
