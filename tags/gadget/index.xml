      <description>A little history I have spent a lot of time on reading, researching tech gadgets articles and products, sometimes I’ll really buy some of them that I think are useful and interesting. I was mesmerized by Jawbone UP as soon as it came out — not only for the idea but also for its features were all I wanted at that time.
Without any doubt, I purchased one from the Internet even it had never been released in China.</description>
