      <description>I spent about three hours to migrate my tech blog from OpenShift &amp;amp; CloudFlare to GitHub again, after my moving all from GitHub to OpenShift about 2 month ago. Experience with OpenShift &amp;amp; CloudFlare was frustrating and awful. It didnâ€™t hit any expectations that I thought before the first migration.
Why I want to use CDN Choosing a free hosting by OpenShift for me is mesmerized by its potential customization in the future, rather than cost consideration.</description>
