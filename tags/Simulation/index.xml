      <description>Why we need network simulation As a network engineer, I have to spend a lot of time in the lab or test environment on testing concepts, configuration, troubleshooting and so on. This is also true for people whose work environment is related to a network such as developers, DBAs. The problem here is that the lab sometimes so perfect that it cannot emulate the real world flaws like latency, packet loss, re-order or bandwidth limitation.</description>
