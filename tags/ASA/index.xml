      <description>Cisco ASA firewall has upgraded its command line at the version 8.3 and changed a lot of configurations from their previous style. I recently faced two cases about NO-NAT in both version and want to leave a quick note here.
Example details:
 inside IP address: 1.1.1.0/24 outside IP address: 2.2.2.0/24 traffic go through from inside interface to outside interface  Before 8.3 An access-list is needed to filter the interested traffic.</description>
