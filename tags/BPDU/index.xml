      <description>I read Michaelâ€™s new blog post about how to reduce the possibility of the network unavailable time. He talked about BPDU filter and BPDU guard in his second point, and it was quite a confusion that they seem the same. But actually, they are not.
BPDU is short for the phrase Bridge Protocol Data Unit, which is part of the STP that helps describe and identify attributes of a switch port.</description>
