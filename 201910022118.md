# are they under a single topic?

materials can be under the same topic or not based on the collecting perspective (as the topic), for example[^09D3BB9E6FB1] [^BF4B36F92A08]:

If the topic is discussing GTD methodology, then the followings in the same topic:
* What is GTD
* comparison of GTD against other methods
* general principles
* recommendation tools
* etc.

but if the topic is about GTD workflow, then
* general principles
* recommendation tools
are in one note, but
* introduction of GTD
* comparison
are not

Similarly, if the focus is how to apply GTD, then we can consider
* general principles
* recommendation tools
can be re-mixed horizontally[^footnote].


[^footnote]: which tool is best for which step, different practices of each step with different tools, etc.
